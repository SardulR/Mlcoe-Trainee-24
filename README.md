# MLCOE Trainee 24 Repository

Welcome to the MLCOE Trainee 24 Repository. This repository serves as a centralized location for all project code developed by the MLCOE trainees. Please follow the instructions outlined below to clone the repository and submit your project code through a Pull Request (PR).

## Getting Started

### Cloning the Repository

To get started, clone the repository to your local environment using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mlcoeakgec/Mlcoe-Trainee-24.git
This command will create a local copy of the repository on your machine.

Forking the Repository
Before making any changes, it is recommended to fork the repository to your own GitHub account. You can do this by clicking the Fork button in the top-right corner of the repository page. This will create a copy of the repository under your account.

Cloning Your Fork
Clone the forked repository using the command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Mlcoe-Trainee-24.git
Replace YOUR-USERNAME with your GitHub username.

Creating a New Branch
Navigate to the repository directory and create a new branch using:

bash
Copy code
cd Mlcoe-Trainee-24
git checkout -b your-name-project-name
Replace your-name-project-name with your full name and the name of your project (e.g., ananya-image-classifier). This ensures that your work is isolated from the main branch.

Submitting Your Project
Organizing Your Code
Create a new folder within the repository named after your project (e.g., Ananya-ImageClassifier).
Place all your project code files inside this folder. Ensure that your code is well-organized, includes necessary documentation, and is functional.
Committing and Pushing Changes
After adding your project folder:

bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Add [Project Name] by [Your Name]"
git push origin your-name-project-name
Replace [Project Name] with the name of your project and [Your Name] with your name.

Raising a Pull Request (PR)
Navigate to the original repository (mlcoeakgec/Mlcoe-Trainee-24) on GitHub.
Click on the Pull Requests tab.
Click the New Pull Request button.
Select your branch (your-name-project-name) and create the pull request.
Provide a clear and concise description of your project and any relevant details when submitting your PR. The repository maintainers will review your submission, and any required changes will be communicated through the PR comments.

Review Process
Ensure that your PR is compliant with the repositoryâ€™s guidelines and standards. Address any feedback provided during the review process and make the necessary updates. Push the changes to the same branch to keep your PR updated.
